# Reporting an issue

## Before reporting

If you have found an issue with CMF3 please make sure that CMF3 really is the cause of the problem. To do this try to reproduce the issue with using only `CMF3` on a newly created mission.

Indicate if the issue appears on stable or development version. In case it is the development version, please also include the commit SHA-1 hash.

**Please note:**
- It's not a valid to simply remove <code>CMF3</code> from the mission to confirm that CMF3 is the culprit.
- If the error happens when using a <b>third-party script or framework</b> contact the author of the appropriate mod and report the issue there.

## Reporting the issue

Head over to the [CMF3 GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/clustermod/CMF3/issues) and press the [New issue](https://github.com/clustermod/CMF3/issues/new) button in the top right corner. Add a descriptive title and complete the issue template.

A video of the issue might be helpful in resolving it faster.
